# Visualizing Global Refugee Crisis using Pythonic ETL

This is my first PyCon 2018 Submission. :) 

This project focuses on studying United Nation's global refugee crisis pertaining to migration, refugee populations and demographics. 

Focus is heavy on data exploration that includes migratory analysis based on population and demographics such as refugee status analysis based on country of residence and origins, total refugee population comparison by pythonic ETL using core built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, nested dictionaries, tuples, and namedtuples.  As for data visualization, Python data science packages include Matplotlib, Basemap, Pandas, Numpy, and RESTFUl API are used to illustrate data insights. 

Source: UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency) http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/time_series.  The data consists of year, population type, population count, origin and country of asylum. This study specifically focuses on the 10 year span from 2007 - 2016, except for the two refugee categories “asylum-seeking” and “refugee (incl. refugee-like situations)”, for which data is given only for the last 3 years, so the data from 2014 - 2016 is analyzed in more depth.

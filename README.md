# Visualizing Global Refugee Crisis using Pythonic_ETL

This is my first PyCon 2018 Submission. 

This project focuses on studying United Nation's global refugee crisis pertaining to migration, refugee populations and demographics. 

Focus is heavy on data exploration that includes migratory analysis based on population and demographics such as refugee statuses,
country of residence and origins that were impacted most, and outliers using Python: Matplotlib, Basemap, Pandas, Numpy, and RESTFUl API to develop ETL and analytics.
